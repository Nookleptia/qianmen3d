Serious Gaming for the Evaluation of Market Mechanisms

Design science consists of two major design processes: building and evaluation. A well executed evaluation of design artifacts is crucial to their success. Traditional evaluation tools have certain weaknesses because design artifacts include ¡°wicked¡± problems. Serious Gaming can help to overcome these problems. To this end an online based cloud resource managing game is developed which simulates the implementation of a market mechanism and represents a new design artifact. This mechanism is a heuristic solution consisting of dynamic pricing and a priority policy. The aim of this research is to show that Serious Gaming complements traditional evaluation tools and improves the evaluation of market mechanisms. Therefore, a general guideline for designing Serious Games for evaluation is developed and a classification of Serious Gaming is established. After having collected sufficient data, future work will be to analyze players¡¯ behavior and finally evaluate the market mechanism.
